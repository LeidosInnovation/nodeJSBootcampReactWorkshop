# React.js To-Do List Example With REST API for Training #
## With redux-thunk Example ##

This repository was used (and will most likely be used in future) as part of a series of JavaScript training presentations given in a corporate IT environment.

The background is that an Angular.js example was proposed as a training exercise, which was in turn based on [this video presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFP0oXNNveg&index=22&list=PLuWFibXQR6m75D-X9sBqvBntotbgP_4GE) by Traversy Media. I proposed giving an example of implementing the same thing with React. The goal was to achieve identical functionality using both "frameworks".

To fully understand how this was used, please read the Word document found in the root of the repository.

## redux-thunk example ##
I was asked to give a second presentation and decided I wanted to talk about Redux, but I didn't know at the time how to implement this example so I did something else. [I posted a question to the JavaScript group on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/comm/groups/121615/121615-6273683704166518784?midToken=AQEug6fZbKuN1Q&trk=eml-b2_anet_digest_of_digests-hero-11-discussion~subject&trkEmail=eml-b2_anet_digest_of_digests-hero-11-discussion~subject-null-a6h0c~j3eq0tsx~nt-null-communities~group~discussion&lipi=urn:li:page:email_b2_anet_digest_of_digests;ZVlzeME1R5qvV5Pjyi0R8Q==) (not sure if this link works for those not subscribed to the group). In response to the huge number of helpful responses I got, I decided to add examples to this repository. The first one uses redux-thunk. I used [this tutorial](https://codepen.io/stowball/post/a-dummy-s-guide-to-redux-and-thunk-in-react) as a guide.c

## redux-saga example ##
I have added a redux-saga example. It is working as far as initial page load. I am using a promise, based on [this example](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga/tree/master/examples/async). I hope to finish this soon.
